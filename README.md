# About the pack
**S-Tweaks** is just a texturepack wich makes your Minecraft **UI** more **lite** and **modern**. The hotbar is inspired by the Windows 10 App highlighting. The changed UI contains **no shading** or other complex effects wich make them a lot more easy to read.


# **⚠️WARNING⚠️**
**THIS RESSOURCEPACK HAVE BUGS AND LOOK MIGHT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM VERSION TO VERSION**

# How I can install it
1. Download the Pack over the Version section in the Version you want to play with. If you cant find your version try a similar version out. For more information look below the Suported versions heading.
2. Now start Minecraft in the version of your texturepack. When you are using a custom client like Lunar or Badlion the installation might work a little bit different. Then you should read the documentation of the client about this.
3. Now you have to click on Options and then on Ressourcepacks.
4. Now you need to click on the left button called Open Pack Folder.
5. Then your file Browser will open ans you now have to put the ressorcepack from the folder were you saved them in step 1. This can work different from Operaiting System to Operaiting System. In my case on Windows 11 you can simply drag and drop the files or copy and paste them. On Linux and Mac it might will work similar.
6. Now you simply go back to Minecraft and click on the ▶️ button on the now appeared ressourcepack under the Available section. When tehre comes a message like "This pack was not made for this version." simply ignore them and click on Yes.
7. Now click on done and be happy with your new Ressourcepack☺.
